Try Out an Agent that Calls Python Functions
Try out this agent that can call Python functions.
When you run the second block in the notebook, the agent will prompt you for what action to take. You can say something like "tell me the files in the current directory" and it will make the appropriate tool choice. Experiment with the agent to see what it can and cannot do. 

Look for an input like this beneath the second code block to type your command into and hit enter. Remember, this agent can only list the files in the directory and read files.
